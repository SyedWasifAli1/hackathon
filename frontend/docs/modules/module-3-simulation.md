# Module 3: Simulation Environments (Gazebo & Unity)

## Learning Goals

In this module, students will:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environment
- Create custom robot models for simulation
- Integrate Unity with robotics workflows
- Implement physics-based simulation scenarios
- Connect simulated sensors to ROS 2 nodes

## Week Overview

This week explores simulation environments crucial for robotics development. We'll work with both Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for realistic rendering, learning how to test algorithms and train AI models in safe, controlled environments.

## Required Readings

- Chapter 3: Simulation Environments (Gazebo & Unity)
- Gazebo Documentation: Tutorials and Best Practices
- Unity Robotics Hub Documentation
- Supplementary reading on sim-to-real transfer techniques

## Activities

1. **Reading**: Complete Chapter 3 on simulation environments
2. **Hands-on Lab**: Install and configure Gazebo simulation
3. **Exercise**: Create a simple robot model in URDF/SDF
4. **Assignment**: Implement a navigation task in simulation
5. **Discussion**: Compare Gazebo vs Unity for different use cases

## Assessment

- **Lab Report**: Document your robot model and simulation setup (due by end of week)
- **Participation**: Active engagement in discussion forums
- **Quiz**: Online quiz covering simulation concepts and tools

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- ROS 2 fundamentals (from Module 2)
- Basic programming skills

## Estimated Duration

- Reading: 2-3 hours
- Activities: 4-5 hours
- Assessment: 2-3 hours
- Total: 8-11 hours for the week

## Resources

- Textbook chapters
- Gazebo tutorials
- Unity Robotics Hub examples
- Sample robot models
- Discussion forums

## Getting Started

Begin by reading Chapter 3, then install Gazebo following the setup instructions. The hands-on lab can be started early in the week to allow time for troubleshooting any installation issues.
