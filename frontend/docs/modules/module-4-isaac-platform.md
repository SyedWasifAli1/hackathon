# Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Platform and GPU-Accelerated Robotics

## Learning Goals

In this module, students will:
- Understand the NVIDIA Isaac platform architecture
- Set up Isaac Sim for robotics simulation
- Implement GPU-accelerated perception pipelines
- Use Isaac ROS for hardware acceleration
- Integrate Isaac with other robotics frameworks

## Week Overview

This week introduces the NVIDIA Isaac platform, a comprehensive robotics platform that combines hardware and software to accelerate AI-powered robotics applications. We'll explore how GPU computing capabilities enable real-time perception, planning, and control for robotic systems.

## Required Readings

- Chapter 4: NVIDIA Isaac Platform and GPU-Accelerated Robotics
