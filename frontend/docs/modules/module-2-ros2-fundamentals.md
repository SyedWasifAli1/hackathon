# Module 2: Fundamentals of Robot Operating System (ROS 2)

## Learning Goals

In this module, students will:
- Understand the core concepts and architecture of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and workspaces
- Implement nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Work with ROS 2 launch files and parameters
- Integrate ROS 2 with Physical AI systems

## Week Overview

This week focuses on the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), a flexible framework for writing robot software. We'll explore its architecture, tools, and conventions that simplify creating complex and robust robot behavior across various robot platforms.

## Required Readings
